this is a sprite renderer/editor

you can design buildings with convex hulls, import milkshape 3d models

render instructions like tile orientations (for inclines), 
render animation frame ranges,
render from 8 different angles,
save your sprite projects, etc.
uses diffuse, specular, and normal/bump mapping

also thinking about adding particle effect animation sprite rendering

all sprites are saved in .png format with transparency and .txt file with x,y offsets
